\title{Graph-based two-sample tests}
\usage{
g_tests(df1, df2, method = "euclidean")
}
\arguments{
\item{df1, df2}{dataframes}

\item{method}{distance measure. Must be one of "euclidean" (default),
"maximum", "manhattan", "canberra", "binary" or "minkowski". See `method`
in `?dist`.}
}
\description{
Test if `df1` and `df2` come from the same distribution. This is a wrapper
of `g.tests` in which the edge matrix of the similarity graph is based on a
minimum spanning tree of the combined data frame.
}
\examples{
## Expect failure to reject null.
g_tests(data.frame(x = rnorm(100)), data.frame(x = rnorm(100)))

## Expect rejection of the null.
g_tests(data.frame(x = rnorm(100)), data.frame(x = runif(100)))
